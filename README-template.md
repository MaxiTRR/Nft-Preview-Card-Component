### What I learned
Another fairly simple challenge. Basically copy almost the same code that you made for the QR Code Component challenge, adapting it to the current challenge requirement. Many recommendations from the previous challenge were that I could summarize my html code if I didn't use a lot of wrapper tags, but I found that I couldn't get things to work the way I wanted if I did, and I feel more comfortable this way than wanting to. adding modifications I can make sure things line up right (or close to it) from the start. Something new that I was able to implement this time is to perform the hover effect on other html elements that are not just links or buttons, which turned out to be a bit complicated without using tutorials.
